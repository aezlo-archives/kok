  <p class="retro-open">Welcome to the site of Aezlo. This was created with the craft and patience of me. Aezlo is a theme of <span class="dream">dream</span> <span>and</span> <span class="heart">heart</span> to create a retro themed site. Scroll down and visit my <span class="creations">creations</span>. Normally, I would spend my time playing games whether it is on the internet or not. My favourite games are <span class="aezlo"><a href="https://www.mcleodgaming.com/games/ssf2">Super Smash Flash 2</a></span> and <span class="aezlo"><a href="https://kizi.com/games/diesel-and-death">Diesel and Death</span></a>. My blog is located at <span class="aezlo"><a href="/tHeAeThEr">The Aether</a></span>.
   Scroll below to find experiments and creations of mine that took an age to make. Anyways, go to <span class="aezlo"><a href="https://github.com/aezloZ/aezloZ.github.io/">this link</a></span> to find the origin of this retro site and this link for <span class="aezlo"><a href="https://codepen.io/trueAether">codepen</a></span>. Finally, remember to enjoy the retro qualities of this site and to be to aezlo.</p>
