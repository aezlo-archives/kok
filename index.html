  <p class="retro-open">Welcome to the site of Aezlo. This was created with the craft and patience of me. Aezlo is a theme of <span class="dream">dream</span> <span>and</span> <span class="heart">heart</span> to create a retro themed site. Scroll down and visit my <span class="creations">creations</span>. Normally, I would spend my time playing games whether it is on the internet or not. My favourite games are <span class="aezlo><a href="https://www.mcleodgaming.com/games/ssf2">Super Smash Flash 2</span></a> and <span class="aezlo"><a href="https://kizi.com/games/diesel-and-death">Diesel and Death</span></a>
